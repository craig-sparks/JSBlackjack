## About
I wrote this after a absence from programming. I used it as a getting back into project. I chose to do it in javascript because it has historically been one of my weaker languages. 

I used https://www.thatsoftwaredude.com/content/6196/coding-a-card-deck-in-javascript as a basis for this game, but I tried to not follow along too much.


## Game Limitations
This game has many limitations as it currently exists

* Easily cheated (looking at the source will give it away)
* No ability to split hands
* No insurance
* BUGS EXIST

## Coding Limitations
This game code could be improved (and probably will be) with some of the following

* Event listeners instead of the adhoc functional method used
* Improved ES9 coding
* Moving HTML code from the script to predefined blocks in the HTMl file
* Shuffling could be more efficient
* Issues with CSS exist as well

## Conclusion
This game is not meant to be used for anything other than a reference at this point, but it could be improved to make it fully functional. If somebody would want to make this a legit game, it would require a backend component with more secured card identification.
