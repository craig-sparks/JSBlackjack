## About
I wrote this after a absence from programming. I used it as a getting back into project. I chose to do it in javascript because it has historically been one of my weaker languages. 


## Game Limitations
This game has many limitations as it currently exists

* Easily cheated (looking at the source will give it away)
* No ability to split hands
* No insurance
* BUGS EXIST

## Coding Limitations
This game code could be improved (and probably will be) with some of the following

* Event listeners instead of the adhoc functional method used
* Improved ES9 coding
* Moving HTML code from the script to predefined blocks in the HTMl file
